**Description:**

This is a the final project of CS5800 Algorithms course.

Our project aims to explore how they can be integrated into real-life situations, with a focus on optimizing routes for travel plans. For the purpose of this project, the scenario will be optimizing the route to visit parks in the Greater Vancouver area, considering both distance and the user’s preference for specific facilities. 

Our approach involves harnessing the Parks database  and Parks Facilities database  available at the City of Vancouver public data website, during which sorting algorithms and filtering techniques will be discussed. In the route optimization process, graph theories will be discussed. 

For the cost of each route, the parameters taken into consideration are the user’s current location, proposed distance range and facility preference, and the direct distance between parks. Time difference in transportation methods will not be considered.
